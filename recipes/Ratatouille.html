    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ratatouille is a classic French vegetable stew that originates from Provence, made with a colorful medley of
        fresh ingredients like eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, and herbs. The vegetables are
        typically sautéed and simmered until tender, allowing their flavors to meld beautifully. Light, hearty, and full
        of rustic charm, ratatouille can be served hot or cold, as a main dish or a flavorful side.</p>
