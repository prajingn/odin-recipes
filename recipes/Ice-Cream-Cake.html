        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ gallon chocolate ice cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine chocolate cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium
            speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, remove the carton paper from ice cream. Set ice cream block on its long side. Use a piece of
            string or dental floss to cut ice cream in half lengthwise, then place the 2 pieces side-by-side on a sheet
            of waxed paper.</li>

        <li>Remove cooled cake from the baking dish and place over the ice cream slabs. Trim cake and ice cream, so the
            edges are flush.</li>
        <li>Place a board or serving platter over cake. Holding onto the waxed paper and board, flip ice cream cake
            over. Remove the waxed paper and smooth the seam between the ice cream slabs.</li>
